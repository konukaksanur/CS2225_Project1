This program multiplies two positive natural numbers of (theoretically) infinitely many digits specified in any-base number system such as binary, octal, decimal etc. (but no number base system larger than the decimal system is mandatory). The multiplicand, the multiplier and the result should be shown both in the original number system presented to this program and in the decimal system.
